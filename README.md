# **[Alaska Quiz Team](https://jacquesiversen.github.io/REDO-PP2/)**

This project came together to accommodate an understanding in JavaScript language. Alot of the methodology is used similar to React, but without the smart features that might add. This site follows a fictional quiz community in Alaska, however they are not very active, as they only have one current quiz available.
